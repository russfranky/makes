You are an expert in monorepo architecture and tooling. I need you to generate complete, production-ready configuration files and setup instructions for a pnpm workspace monorepo with Turborepo, designed to manage multiple Make applications (originally from Figma).

Requirements
Project Structure:

Project name: hubzz-makes

Framework: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript

Package manager: pnpm (strict version management)

Build orchestration: Turborepo

Target: 3-30+ Make applications sharing common utilities

Workspace Layout:

apps/ - Individual Make applications

packages/ - Shared utilities, UI components, configurations

Root - Monorepo coordination and shared dependencies

Must Include:

Complete folder structure with all critical files

Root package.json with correct workspace configuration and scripts

pnpm-workspace.yaml for workspace definition

turbo.json with task definitions and caching strategy

Root tsconfig.json for shared TypeScript configuration

.npmrc for pnpm optimization settings

Sample Make app structure (apps/make-example/)

Sample shared package (packages/shared-utils/)

GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD with remote caching

Comprehensive setup instructions (bash commands)

Development workflow documentation

Scaling guidelines for adding new Makes

Technical Specifications:

Node.js 18+ compatible

TypeScript 5.0+

ESLint + Prettier for code quality

Environment variable handling across workspaces

Support for both CLI tools and applications

Fast incremental builds with caching

Independent deployment capability per Make

Output Format:

Provide each file as a separate, complete, copy-paste-ready code block with filename indicated. Follow with bash commands for complete automated setup. End with troubleshooting section and best practices.

PROMPT STRUCTURE (Use Exactly As Written)
I need complete, production-ready configuration files and setup for a pnpm monorepo with Turborepo for managing Figma Make applications. The monorepo must support:

Single shared node_modules for all workspace packages

Multiple independent Make apps under apps/ directory

Shared utilities and configurations under packages/ directory

Fast builds with Turborepo caching and task orchestration

CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions

TypeScript support with strict type checking across workspaces

Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier)

Easy scaling to 30+ Makes without structural changes

Generate the following files in this exact order:

Files to Generate:
package.json (root) - Workspace root configuration

pnpm-workspace.yaml - pnpm workspace definition

turbo.json - Turborepo task configuration

tsconfig.json (root) - Shared TypeScript configuration

.npmrc - pnpm optimization settings

.gitignore - Version control exclusions

apps/make-example/package.json - Example Make app

apps/make-example/tsconfig.json - App-specific TypeScript config

apps/make-example/next.config.js - Next.js configuration

packages/shared-utils/package.json - Shared utilities package

packages/shared-utils/tsconfig.json - Package TypeScript config

packages/shared-utils/src/index.ts - Entry point with example exports

packages/config/package.json - Shared configuration package

packages/config/tsconfig.json - Config package TypeScript setup

.github/workflows/ci.yml - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

README.md - Complete setup and usage guide

SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.sh - Automated bash setup script

After all files, provide:

Step-by-step manual setup commands

Use This Exact Prompt
When submitting to an AI, copy the text between the first "---" and this final "---" mark. The AI will generate all files needed for complete monorepo setup.

Alternative: Quick Copy Command
If you want to save this and use it in a file:

bash
# Save prompt to file
cat > monorepo-setup-prompt.txt << 'PROMPT_END'
[PASTE THE PROMPT SECTION ABOVE HERE]
PROMPT_END

# Then use with Claude/ChatGPT
# Paste the content of monorepo-setup-prompt.txt into your AI
What You'll Get Back
The AI will provide:

✅ 18+ production-ready configuration files
✅ Complete directory structure (ready to create)
✅ Automated setup script (bash commands)
✅ GitHub Actions workflow (for CI/CD)
✅ Troubleshooting guide with solutions
✅ Scaling documentation for 30+ Makes
✅ Development workflow documentation
✅ TypeScript type definitions across workspaces
✅ ESLint/Prettier configuration
✅ Environment variable handling patterns

Next Steps After Running Prompt
Copy all generated files into your project directory

Run the setup script provided by AI

Verify with test commands (build, dev, lint)

Commit to Git with proper .gitignore

Add to GitHub and enable Actions

Start migrating Makes into apps/ folder

Pro Tips
Keep this prompt handy - When you need to add new tools or change configuration later, reference this and ask the AI for updates.

Version control the setup - Commit all generated files to track configuration history.

Use filtered commands - pnpm turbo build --filter=make-auth to work with specific Makes.

Enable remote caching - Add Vercel/Turbo credentials to .env.local for team caching benefits.
